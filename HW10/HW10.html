<h3>When I embarked on this project, I sought to see what proportion of mine reclamation sites were either within or near wilderness areas in Nevada.  I initially plotted the mine reclamation sites and the wilderness areas to see if there was any intersection.  There was none so I increased to a 15km buffer as I had estimated this would produce some meaningful intersections.  15km is still close enough for pollution from tailings seepage into groundwater and runoff into nearby streams to present problems.  Reassuringly, the majority of reclamation sites are not within 15km of wilderness areas.  To conduct the assessment, I used the buffer feature to create the 15km radii and the intersect feature to see where the wilderness areas and reclamation site buffers intersected.</h3>
